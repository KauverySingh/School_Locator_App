# School_Locator_Web_Application


Developed a school locator web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, fetching school data from a JSON file and presenting an efficient order of school locations based on user-entered pincode using the TSP algorithm.

This project is a school locator web application that allows users to find schools based on a specific pincode. The application takes a pincode as input from the user and displays an efficient order of school locations, matching that pincode, using the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) algorithm. The project is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it utilizes a JSON file to store the school data.
